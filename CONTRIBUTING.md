Contributions to Patience Deck are welcome. However, please take the
time to read this document first.

If you have a question, Github issues is not the right place for that.
You may send your question to [Openrepos page of Patience
Deck](https://openrepos.net/content/tomin/patience-deck) or directly to
me via email. I will do my best to reply to you. I'm also on Sailfish OS
forum where you may send me a direct message.

Please report any bugs (issues) and feature requests via Github issues,
but if you can't do that, you may also contact me directly. I may then
create an issue on your behalf.

If you would like to contiribute code, please consider the following:
- If you want to fix something small, please create a pull request in
  Github. I will read it through when I have time and comment if I
  disagree with something. If you can't create a pull request, then you
  can also email me the patches. Please use git send-email to do that.
- For bigger changes, I encourage you to first create a Github issue
  about that or discuss it with me first. This is to avoid wasting time
  working towards wrong implementation and then having to spend a lot of
  time getting it right. That can be frustrating to both of us. However,
  if you just want to hack on Patience Deck, feel free to do so.

If you have any questions that weren't answered here, feel free to ask.
I'm best reached over email (for example tomi (plus) patience-deck (at)
tomin (dot) site), through [Patience Deck Openrepos
page](https://openrepos.net/content/tomin/patience-deck) which I
frequently visit or on Sailfish OS forum as user tomin.
